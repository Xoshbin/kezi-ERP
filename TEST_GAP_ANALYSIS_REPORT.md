# Test Gap Analysis Report - JMeryar ERP

**Date:** 2026-01-17
**Total Tests Found:** ~1,500 test cases across all modules
**Test Framework:** Pest PHP with Laravel/Filament testing utilities

---

## Executive Summary

The JMeryar ERP now has a **strong test suite** for its core Accounting, Inventory, and Manufacturing modules. Significant progress has been made in the HR module, raising its coverage from zero to moderate. Cross-cutting concerns like browser testing and RBAC validation remain the primary gaps.

## 6. Prioritized Action Plan

### 🔴 Priority 1: CRITICAL (Immediate)

1. **Sales Actions** - 12/21 actions tested (✅ Quote, Sales Order, and Invoice workflow critical actions completed)
   - ✅ Test quote workflow actions (`Accept`, `Reject`, `Send`)
   - ✅ Test invoice update and line creation actions
   - ✅ Test sales order creation action

2. **Purchase Actions** - Only 1/14 actions tested
   - Test RFQ workflow actions
   - Test purchase order workflow actions
   - Test vendor bill creation actions



### 🟡 Priority 2: HIGH (Within 2-4 weeks)

5. **Browser Tests** - Only 1 browser test in entire codebase
   - Add browser tests for complex Filament forms
   - Add browser tests for critical user workflows

6. **End-to-End Integration Tests**
   - Full sales cycle test
   - Full purchase cycle test
   - Full manufacturing to accounting test

7. **Missing Filament Resource Tests**
   - Manufacturing resources (critical)
   - HR resources (high priority)
   - ProjectManagement resources

### 🟢 Priority 3: MEDIUM (Within 1-2 months)

8. **Service Layer Tests**
   - Sales services (InvoiceService, QuoteService)
   - Purchase services (PurchaseOrderService, etc.)
   - ProjectManagement services

9. **RBAC Extended Tests**
   - Role-based action visibility
   - Cross-company data isolation

10. **Edge Case Tests**
    - Race condition tests
    - Error handling tests
    - Validation boundary tests

---

## 7. Recommendations

### 7.1 Immediate Actions

1. **Set up test coverage reporting** (e.g., with `paratest` and coverage)
2. **Create test templates** for Actions, Services, and Filament Resources
3. **Prioritize Manufacturing tests** - This module is a black hole of test coverage
4. **Add browser testing infrastructure** - Extend Pest browser plugin usage

### 7.2 Process Improvements

1. **Enforce TDD** - No PR merges without corresponding tests
2. **Create test checklists** per module for new features
3. **Add mutation testing** to verify test quality
4. **Set minimum coverage thresholds** (suggest 80% for new code)

### 7.3 Technical Debt

1. **Consolidate duplicate test patterns** (e.g., VendorBillResourceTest exists twice)
2. **Standardize test file locations** (some tests are in Accounting folder for Payment module)
3. **Create shared test builders** for complex scenarios
